# Awesome Ranked Agent Orchestrators [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A daily-refreshed copy of [andyrewlee/awesome-agent-orchestrators](https://github.com/andyrewlee/awesome-agent-orchestrators) where every listed project is enriched with its GitHub star count and each section is sorted by stars (highest first).


The remainder of the README stays identical to the source:

-----
A curated list of open source and source available tools for orchestrating agents.

Prefer a web version? Visit [agent-orchestrators.com](https://agent-orchestrators.com) for more information on each tool.

**Run several agents at once and review each diff.** Parallel Coding Agents — Terminal (TUI/CLI) if you live in tmux; Desktop & Web if you want a GUI or phone access.

**Keep an agent working while you're away.** Autonomous Loop Runners drive one goal until it verifies; Autonomous Task Runners pull work from an issue tracker, board, or schedule.

**Have agents split a large job between themselves.** Multi-Agent Swarms.

**Message an agent instead of opening a tool.** Personal Assistants stay running, remember across sessions, and pick up work from a chat thread — general tasks, not only code.

**Build your own orchestrator.** Agent Infrastructure & Primitives — control planes, coordination protocols, harness adapters, and runtimes.

## Parallel Coding Agents — Terminal (TUI/CLI)

Run and supervise several agent sessions side by side from a terminal — tmux panes, git worktrees, and TUI dashboards.


- [herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr) ⭐44.7k - Background runtime that owns your agents' terminals: sessions survive reboot and reattach from any terminal or SSH, panes are marked working/blocked/idle, and agents themselves spawn panes and prompt each other over a CLI and socket API. One Rust binary.
- [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux) ⭐28.2k - Ghostty-based macOS terminal with vertical tabs and per-agent notifications, built for keeping many concurrent sessions legible.
- [claude-squad](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad) ⭐8.6k - Runs each agent as a detached background session with its own worktree, so work continues after you close the pane. Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Amp.
- [tuios](https://github.com/Gaurav-Gosain/tuios) ⭐5.5k - A terminal window manager that knows what your agents are doing. Tile panes across nine workspaces in the terminal you already use.

- [Calyx](https://github.com/yuuichieguchi/Calyx) ⭐348 - Native macOS terminal built on libghostty with an approval inbox for permission prompts, a working/blocked/idle sidebar, and in-terminal diff review.
- [Rove](https://github.com/Sma1lboy/rove) ⭐176 - TUI orchestrator that gives each task its own git worktree and branch, with sessions that survive detach or dropped SSH, a Kanban board whose cards launch sessions and get moved by agents, and a `rove api` for agents to dispatch tasks that report back.

- [lorca](https://github.com/egoist/lorca) ⭐311 - E2E-encrypted personal agent chat: create bots, talk 1:1 or in group chats, and let them hand work to each other. Rust CLI, native macOS client, and phone apps.
- [Comma](https://github.com/AFK-surf/Comma) ⭐268 - Sessionless personal agent that breaks goals into tasks and keeps working through agentic loops across your computer, phone, and browser, with computer use, files, and remote control; self-hostable (AGPL-3.0).
- [iva](https://github.com/smixs/iva-agent) ⭐258 - Telegram assistant that turns your messages, voice notes and photos into an Obsidian-compatible markdown vault it remembers across sessions. Crons, skills, MCP and Google Workspace from an in-chat menu. Self-hosted in one command, MIT.
- [PersonalJarvis](https://github.com/PersonalJarvis/PersonalJarvis) ⭐238 - Desktop voice and chat assistant for Windows, macOS, and Linux that runs CLI coding agents such as Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI side by side in Git worktrees, with memory, scheduled routines, and any single model key or local models via Ollama.
- [Xiryn](https://github.com/SouravBeraAkaSpeed/xiryn) ⭐189 - Open-source personal agent on your own machine: each agent gets its own Linux desktop in Docker, with an encrypted vault, any model under your keys, and Telegram control.
- [Overlay](https://github.com/LayerNorm/overlay-web) ⭐184 - Open-source workspace where humans and agents share context — knowledge, files, memory, connected apps — so you delegate repeatable work to agents, review what they produce, and take action through tools, provider-neutral.
- [lemon](https://github.com/z80dev/lemon) ⭐132 - Local-first assistant and coding agent runtime.
- [automata](https://github.com/sentientwave/automata) ⭐114 - Matrix-native workspace where Temporal-backed durable workflows survive restarts and keep long tasks moving.

- [jelly](https://github.com/dctanner/jelly) ⭐60 - Local-first multi-bot system for running your operation from one VM: persistent agents grouped into project directories, phone-friendly web UI via Tailscale, browser control, and sudo on request.
- [Grux](https://github.com/dotcomjack/grux) ⭐30 - Native macOS agent that runs agent swarms in parallel, opens terminal sessions it can undo, and reaches your mail, calendar and meetings; runs on a local Ollama model or your own Anthropic key, and any coding agent can drive it over MCP or its CLI.
- [lucinate](https://github.com/lucinate-ai/lucinate) ⭐12 - Terminal-native chat client for OpenClaw, Hermes, Ollama, and OpenAI-compatible providers, with cron management and session browsing.

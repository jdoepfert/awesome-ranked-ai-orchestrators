# Awesome Ranked Agent Orchestrators [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A daily-refreshed copy of [andyrewlee/awesome-agent-orchestrators](https://github.com/andyrewlee/awesome-agent-orchestrators) where every listed project is enriched with its GitHub star count and each section is sorted by stars (highest first).


The remainder of the README stays identical to the source:

-----
A curated list of open source and source available tools for orchestrating agents.

Prefer a web version? Visit [agent-orchestrators.com](https://agent-orchestrators.com) for more information on each tool.

**Run several agents at once and review each diff.** Parallel Coding Agents — Terminal (TUI/CLI) if you live in tmux; Desktop & Web if you want a GUI or phone access.

**Keep an agent working while you're away.** Autonomous Loop Runners drive one goal until it verifies; Autonomous Task Runners pull work from an issue tracker, board, or schedule.

**Have agents split a large job between themselves.** Multi-Agent Swarms.

**Message an agent instead of opening a tool.** Personal Assistants stay running, remember across sessions, and pick up work from a chat thread — general tasks, not only code.

**Build your own orchestrator.** Agent Infrastructure & Primitives — control planes, coordination protocols, harness adapters, and runtimes.

## Parallel Coding Agents — Terminal (TUI/CLI)

Run and supervise several agent sessions side by side from a terminal — tmux panes, git worktrees, and TUI dashboards.


- [herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr) ⭐45.9k - Background runtime that owns your agents' terminals: sessions survive reboot and reattach from any terminal or SSH, panes are marked working/blocked/idle, and agents themselves spawn panes and prompt each other over a CLI and socket API. One Rust binary.
- [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux) ⭐28.5k - Ghostty-based macOS terminal with vertical tabs and per-agent notifications, built for keeping many concurrent sessions legible.
- [claude-squad](https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad) ⭐8.7k - Runs each agent as a detached background session with its own worktree, so work continues after you close the pane. Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Amp.
- [tuios](https://github.com/Gaurav-Gosain/tuios) ⭐6k - A terminal window manager that knows what your agents are doing. Tile panes across nine workspaces in the terminal you already use. A daemon keeps sessions running when you detach and reaches your other machines. The coding agents in your panes report what they are doing, and one Inbox holds everything they are waiting on. Agent integration for claude-code, codex, gemini-cli, opencode, amp, antigravity, copilot, crush, cursor-agent, devin, droid, grok, hermes, kilo, kimi, pi, omp, qoder, qwen.

- [termany](https://github.com/thinkany-ai/termany) ⭐490 - Terminal that keeps many agent sessions in one window, tagging each pane working/done/needs-attention from the running job rather than the shell prompt, with diffs, worktrees, port handling, remote hosts, and token cost in the same place.

- [Calyx](https://github.com/yuuichieguchi/Calyx) ⭐347 - Native macOS terminal built on libghostty with an approval inbox for permission prompts, a working/blocked/idle sidebar, and in-terminal diff review.
- [Rove](https://github.com/Sma1lboy/rove) ⭐180 - TUI orchestrator that gives each task its own git worktree and branch, with sessions that survive detach or dropped SSH, a Kanban board whose cards launch sessions and get moved by agents, and a `rove api` for agents to dispatch tasks that report back.

Pi and Codex subagents.
- [agent-console](https://github.com/buhuipao/agent-console) ⭐37 - Rust TUI that finds Codex and Claude Code sessions from the providers' own transcripts, including ones started elsewhere, and resumes their native UI rather than replacing it. No tmux or worktrees.
